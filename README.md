mazeduino
=========
mazeduino is the traditional rat-in-a-maze scenario, but the tables have turned and your'e the rat. you have the same 3 choices the rat has: go forward, turn left, and turn right, and you have the same 3 walls: front, left, and right. 

eventually mazes will be randomly generated. and you will get a piece of cheese at the end.
