mazeduino
=========
mazeduino is the traditional rat-in-a-maze scenario, but the tables have turned and your'e the rat. you have the same 3 choices the rat has: go forward, turn left, and turn right, and you have the same obstacles, walls to your front, left, and right. 

the 3 led pins can run through an amplifier and make bigger 3-walled displays, and the buttons can be replaced with bigger switches, or foot-switches. 

i dont really know anything about actual logic gates, but i hope that parts of this could be translated into 7400n chips for dangerousprototypes' 7400n challenge. 

eventually mazes may be randomly generated, and you'll get a piece of cheese or an animation or something at the end.
